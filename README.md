ResKACNNet: A Novel Backbone for Inertial Localization with Enhanced Long-Term Trajectory Modeling

## Abstract
Inertial localization is essential for positioning in environments where vision, GPS, or radar systems are not available. This paper introduces ResKACNNet, a new inertial localization network that overcomes the limitations of existing CNN-based methods in modeling long-term trajectory dependencies. By utilizing ChebyKAN as the backbone and incorporating an efficient kernel-based self-attention module (EKSA), the proposed method effectively captures complex trajectories and contextual information, leading to significant improvements in modeling long-term dependencies. Our experiments on five public datasets demonstrate a reduction in absolute trajectory error by 3.79%-42.32% compared to current baselines. Furthermore, we offer a preprocessed version of the TLIO dataset with gravity compensation, which has been experimentally proven to enhance inertial localization performance.
