# KANNet
Inertial localization is a crucial positioning solution for constrained environments, such as those involving vision, GPS, or radar. However, existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods for inertial localization exhibit significant limitations when modeling long-term trajectory dependencies. To address this issue, we propose a novel inertial localization network that utilizes the KAN convolution to construct a general backbone. This approach leverages its non-linear learning capability to enhance the modeling of complex trajectories. Additionally, we design an efficient kernel-based self-attention module (EKSA) to capture contextual information along the trajectory, further enhancing the modeling of long-term dependencies. Experimental results on six public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the absolute trajectory error by 6%-13% relative to existing baseline methods. Furthermore, we provide the cleaned TLIO dataset and experimentally validate the importance of gravity removal for improving inertial localization performance.
